# Why is uncertainty often ignored in data analysis?

???

uncertainty refers to our lack of knowledge about something.

the term uncertainty can have many meanings and avoid philosophical debates:
* risk vs. uncertainty from frank knight in economics
* entropy from shannon's information theory
* alea-toric (inherent noise/randomness) vs ep-is-tem-ic (lack sufficient data)

focus on more traditional measurements what is a probability and understanding what are confidence intervals or bayesian statistics

but let's first focus on tendencies to ignore uncertainty

# Why not visualize uncertainty?

#### Cognitively burdensome
#### User won't understand it
#### Implies inappropriate precision
#### Not integral to task
#### Undermines author's credibility
#### Hard to calculate
#### Lack of good visual techniques
#### Hard to evaluate (unclear goals)
#### Unclear if error in data vs uncertainty

[Jessica Hullman, Why Authors Don't Visualize Uncertainty (TVCG 2019)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8805422)

???

1. too busy or cognitively burdening - maybe non-expert?

2. precision vs simplicity

3. hard to calculate: what the heck is a confidence interval anyways?

4. uncertainty visualizations of old are antiquated and things like error bars may be misinterpreted and need better uncertainty representations

5. how do we know if the uncertainty visualization is effective? 

6. ryan -- in industry many companies struggle at data quality and remain fixated on deterministic to ensure "numbers align" and are "correct"

chocolate bar ratings. 

The observations (shown as jittered green dots) that make up the sample represent expert ratings of 125 chocolate bars from manufacturers in Canada, rated on a scale from 1 (unpleasant) to 5 (elite). 

The large orange dot represents the mean of the ratings. Error bars indicate, from top to bottom, twice the standard deviation, twice the standard error (standard deviation of the mean), and 80%, 95%, and 99% confidence intervals of the mean.

standard error is approximately given by the sample standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size

confidence intervals are calculated by multiplying the standard error with small, constant values

For example, a 95% confidence interval extends approximately two times the standard error in either direction from the mean. Therefore, larger samples tend to have narrower standard errors and confidence intervals, even if their standard deviation is the same. 

Error bars are convenient because they allow us to show many estimates with their uncertainties all at once.

[Claus Wilke](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/visualizing-uncertainty.html)


???

Frequentist Confidence intervals (CIs) are best understood in the context of repeated sampling. For each sample, a specific confidence interval either includes or excludes the true parameter, here the mean. However, if we sample repeatedly, then the confidence intervals (shown here are 68% confidence intervals, corresponding to sample mean +/- standard error) include the true mean approximately 68% of the time.

A frequentist confidence interval: “How certain are we that the true parameter value is not zero?”

A Bayesian credible interval: “Where do we expect the true parameter value to lie?”

In practice, however, Bayesian and frequentist estimates are often quite similar. An advantage of the Bayesian approach is that it emphasizes thinking about the magnitude of an effect, whereas the frequentist thinking emphasizes a binary perspective of an effect either existing or not.

[Kale, Kay, and Hullman, "Visual Reasoning Strategies for Effect Size Judgments and Decisions", IEEE Vis 2020 Best Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14516)

???

In an incentivized crowdsource study that won best paper in IEEE Vis -- the top academic conference for data visualization -- researchers studied strategies chart users rely on when making judgments and decisions from visualizations showing the effectiveness of an intervention (i.e., effect size). 

They expected chart users to rely on visual distance between distributions as a proxy for effect size, ignoring the spread of distributions. 

Users compared distributions of outcomes with and without intervention -- in this case whether to add a player to a hypothetical fantasy sports team.

They made two decisions:
1: How many times out of 100 do you estimate that your team would score more points with the new player than without the new player?
2: whether or not to pay for the new player 

They found that many users switch between strategies and seldom use the optimal strategy when one exists. Visualization designers should be mindful of possible strategies and how they may result in unintended readings of charts.

This is critically important for making A/B decisions or evaluating different models. But how could we even get such uncertainty measurements?

I'd like to finish with recent research at UNCC Ribarsky Center for Visual Analytics, which was recently renamed after Dr. Bill Ribarsky, the former UNCC BofA Endowed Chair and Professor who sadly passed in 2017.

Bill had an amazing transformative career where he helped revolutionize visualization research, first in Georgia Tech where he researched VR and interactive visualizations in the 80s - 90s and then transformed UNCC into a powerhouse of the burdening fields of visualization when he joined in 2004.

His enduring partnerships with practice including companies like Bank of America as well as government agencies like the Department of Homeland Security, DOE, U.S. Department of Transportation, EPA showed how relevant vis research is to practioners and we're proud to continue the legacy Bill paved.

# Correlation judgement

[Karduni, Markant, Wesslen, and Dou (IEEE InfoVis 2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00058)

???

In one article published in last year's IEEE InfoVis conference -- the premier academic conference for data vis research -- our research group studied the problem of uncertainty visualizations and their effects in basic correlation judgments.

Data speaks for itself? Really? What about prior beliefs that may influence or effect perception of data?

# Prior beliefs

[Karduni, Markant, Wesslen, and Dou (IEEE InfoVis 2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00058)

???

Instead of data being objective, prior beliefs may constrain perception where individuals who believe contrary to the data may become 

This work is important is because it's a big step towards our ultimate goal: identifying, measuring and hopefully mitigating confirmation bias, which is the tendency to seek only information that confirms ones prior beliefs.

In other applications we've examined this to identifying misinformation on twitter and foresee many other applications.

# Bayesian cognitive modeling

&lt;img src="./img/line-cone.gif" width="900px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

[Karduni, Markant, Wesslen, and Dou (IEEE InfoVis 2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00058)

???

Bayesian cognitive modeling provide a normative benchmark for how beliefs should change depending on the strength of the evidence and participants’ uncertainty. 

For instance, a person who is confident that variables are negatively correlated may only shift their beliefs a small amount after seeing a dataset with a positive sample correlation. 

A second person who is highly uncertain about the relationship, however, may be more strongly influenced by the same data and report posterior beliefs that are closely matched to the sample correlation. 

This framework also allows us to identify when people systematically fail to adjust their beliefs as predicted by the Bayesian model.

# Investing for Retirement

&lt;img src="./img/myopic-loss-aversion2.png" height=46% width=46%&gt;

Wesslen, Karduni, Markant, and Dou (In Review)

???

In our most recent experiment, we leveraged an important idea from Behavorial Economist -- notably 2017 nobel prize winner richard thaler and his then student shlomo benartzi -- on the idea of myopic loss aversion, which is the idea that more we evaluate our portfolios, the higher our chance of seeing a loss and, thus, the more susceptible we are to loss aversion.

in a 1999 experiment, benartzi and thaler found that the way we frame investment returns for long term investing -- like retirement over 30 years -- can have a huge effect on basic allocation decision on stocks versus bonds. their experiment was a powerful explanation for the deep puzzle of the equity premium puzzle in economics, in which economists' mathematical models could not explain the excessively high historical outperformance of stocks over much safer bonds. 

for their simple "pencil-and-paper" experiment, benartzi and thaler asked retirement participants to decide on how to allocate their retirement (invest over 30 years) but randomly choose half of participants to view short term returns, which due to ideas like prospect theory participants were scared by the short term negative losses more than the larger upside of bonds. 

investors seemed to be scared by the negative returns and inable to do the mental accounting that the 1 year returns to 30 years, participants under allocated to stocks and thus likely made in efficient decisions for retirement.

in theory if investing over 30 years, optimal decision is to allocate more to stocks -- key to note true for retirement accounts where need is long term and this may not translate for average investors who's planning horizon is much shorter or may have uncertainty due to unexpected liquidity needs.

### Be thoughtful about uncertainty 

#### - Speed vs precision

#### - Don't automatically sweep under the rug; learn and experiment!

### Think beyond your college (Frequentist) stats class

#### - Computational methods (bootstrap and Bayesian) can be very helpful

#### - New uncertainty open source packages emerging and easier to use

### Better communicate uncertainty, better human-AI collaboration?

#### - Incredibly important for trust and transparency in AI
