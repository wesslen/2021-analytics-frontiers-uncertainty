???

Frequentist Confidence intervals (CIs) are best understood in the context of repeated sampling. For each sample, a specific confidence interval either includes or excludes the true parameter, here the mean. However, if we sample repeatedly, then the confidence intervals (shown here are 68% confidence intervals, corresponding to sample mean +/- standard error) include the true mean approximately 68% of the time.

A frequentist confidence interval: “How certain are we that the true parameter value is not zero?”

A Bayesian credible interval: “Where do we expect the true parameter value to lie?”

In practice, however, Bayesian and frequentist estimates are often quite similar. An advantage of the Bayesian approach is that it emphasizes thinking about the magnitude of an effect, whereas the frequentist thinking emphasizes a binary perspective of an effect either existing or not.

[Kale, Kay, and Hullman, IEEE Vis 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14516)

???

In an incentivized crowdsource study that won best paper in IEEE Vis -- the top academic conference for data visualization -- researchers studied strategies chart users rely on when making judgments and decisions from visualizations showing the effectiveness of an intervention (i.e., effect size). 

They expected chart users to rely on visual distance between distributions as a proxy for effect size, ignoring the spread of distributions. 

Users compared distributions of outcomes with and without intervention -- in this case whether to add a player to a hypothetical fantasy sports team.

They made two decisions:
1: How many times out of 100 do you estimate that your team would score more points with the new player than without the new player?
2: whether or not to pay for the new player 

They found that many users switch between strategies and seldom use the optimal strategy when one exists. Visualization designers should be mindful of possible strategies and how they may result in unintended readings of charts.

This is critically important for making A/B decisions or evaluating different models. But how could we even get such uncertainty measurements?

Bayesian analysis assesses the uncertainty of the hypothesis in light of the observed data, and a frequentist analysis assesses the uncertainty of the observed data in light of an assumed hypothesis.

Bayesian cognitive modeling provide a normative benchmark for how beliefs should change depending on the strength of the evidence and participants’ uncertainty. 

For instance, a person who is confident that variables are negatively correlated may only shift their beliefs a small amount after seeing a dataset with a positive sample correlation. 

A second person who is highly uncertain about the relationship, however, may be more strongly influenced by the same data and report posterior beliefs that are closely matched to the sample correlation. 

This framework also allows us to identify when people systematically fail to adjust their beliefs as predicted by the Bayesian model.
